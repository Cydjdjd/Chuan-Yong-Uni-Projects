  <h1>Done By:Chuan Yong</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The essential story being told by my website is that technology can be a very interesting topic to follow.Given the vast improvements in technology today,everyone should try to be as interested in technology as possible, to keep up
    with the times and to stay relevant. Hence,with my website,I try to present technology in a interesting manner that is engaging, that would interest prospective readers.I tried to implement a structure inspired by a couple of gaming
    websites with technology related advice put into it. The structure of homepage was inspired by a website which talked on templates we can use for webpages, whereas the articles are inspired by numerous gaming webpahes. </p>
  <h2>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website.</h2>
  <p>The first thing that inspired me were gaming websites.The reason why it is so inspired by gaming, is because I find that gaming websites have a very interesting format that helps to capture the interest of readers.This coupled with the
    interesting content of technology,creates an immersive website
    experience.Next, the content was inspired by technology websites across the web,as I used articles from acroos the web that are related to technology.This is to make it more original as opposed to taking content directly from Techadvisor, which
    is the newslatter that I am making a website for.Taking
    content directly from the magazine would make it too unoriginal as techadvisor already has its own website.Lastly, I was inspired by website making related websites that provided me with templates,codes and website design ideas.These website
    provide me with ideas and pre made structures that are easy
    to follow and more professional in a sense.</p>
  <h2>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h2>
  <p>The website is accessible as it involves simple colours which are in this case black and white only.Therefore,this makes it easy for people to read when they are tired and also makes it simpler for people to understand especially for people that
    are impaired to easily use them.It is filled with animations
    that allow the users to easily navigate the website,ensuring that they would be able to view content and interact with the content easily. It has images with alternate text, ensuring that should images fail to load, the text acts as an
    alternative
    replacement,ensuring that people would still be able to understand.
    This also allows screen readers to read the images allowing visually impaired users to use the website.</p>
  <h2>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</h2>
  <p>The website is high in usability as it is highly responsive, and is suited to be used on phones, tablets as well as laptops. It is also good in usability as it contains numerous interesting features such a comments section where you can add
    comments, a searchbar to search for pages, carousels and animations.This
    provides a highly interactive website experience that is enjoyable to the user.Lastly, another aspect that improves usability is that does not have a lot of errors as most of errors have been debugged providing a good website experience.</p>
  <h2>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that</h2>
  <p>I had to learn and find out about how javascript applies to your websites as it was previously not required in the group project, hence it is considered something new and hence i had to do some research on the usage of javascript.Next, I had to
    find out and learn about the various bugs that can occur while
    developing the website.This is because while developing the website unexpected bugs can occur that I would not know how to solve, hence I would have to do some online research or think of a solution on my own to learn how to solve the
    issue.Lastly, I also had to learn and find out moreabout code for more
    completed things such as carousel, animation, search bar and comments section that are not covered as in depth in the syllabus.While the syllabus covers the basics that are needed to implement these functions, researching more helped me to piece
    together a more functional and proffesional looking code 4
    for my website.</p>
  <h2>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h2>
  <p>I think some aspects or my work that worked well are the interactive javascript elements that were introduced. This is because these elements are more advanced and are difficult toimplement,improving the website the website hugely. Another
    aspect that worked well is that the website doesnt look very messy and looks
    neat due to the combination of eneat colors, well-chosen pictures and good alignment of text. It also has a mixture of article layout that uses videos,images and carousels in a way that sets each article apart from each other.</p>
  <h2>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently
    another time?</h2>
  <p>More javascript elements could be introduced to make the website more interactive. Each page could be made even more unique from each other.</p>
  <h2>What resources were used when creating your work?</h2>
  <h3>Online resources</h3>
  <p>I have taken article contents from the below 5 websites but changed the formats of the webpages. I also took a code for image carousel from w3schools.com but changed it a little as it was not working as expected.</p>
